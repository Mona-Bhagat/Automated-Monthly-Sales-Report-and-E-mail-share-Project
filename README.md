![Capture_Report](https://github.com/Mona-Bhagat/Automated-Monthly-Sales-Report-and-E-mail-share-Project/assets/148805047/2c240937-15ab-4e3f-9f07-d986683e7b77)


# Problem Statement
A firm receives monthly sales reports in its Outlook in Excel CSV format. A dedicated resource downloads all the files every month, cleans them, combines the new month's figures with historical data, and then creates a report to be shared with management. This activity takes loads of time every month. This project aims to automate this entire process and produce the report in the form of a Power BI report which gets e-mailed to desired stakeholders automatically. 


# Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this project is 48 Excel CSV files which are monthly sales reports from January 2019 till December 2022. 

# Prerequisites
• The e-mails should have the same subject line so that a new rule of moving the emails to a dedicated folder can be created. 
• All the files should have similar column headings. 


# Tools
	• Excel CSV
  	• Microsoft Outlook
   	• Microsoft Power BI
  
  
# Steps involved

* All the e-mails containing attachments were moved into a dedicated folder with the help of a new rule in Outlook 
* These e-mails were then imported into Power BI 
* The data from the attachments of these emails were pulled into Power Query
* The data was checked and cleaned for any errors or missing values
* All the sales data from January 2019 to December 2022 was ready in appended form
* This data was then visualized in an interactive report and insights drawn 
* The report was then published and automatic e-mails were scheduled to the desired stakeholders



# Value addition to an organization
This automation would help an organization in the following ways:
* Saves on time consumed on monitoring the e-mails, downloading, cleansing, appending, report updation, and mailing the updated report
* Reference - A resource spends 1 hour daily doing the above steps this automation helps save 1 hour * 240 days = 240 hours in a year which when divided by 8 hours per day is 1.25 months in a year
* The average Median salary of a data analyst in the UK is 38,000 GBP per year (Glassdoor, 2023). 1.25 months salary calculates out to be 3,958 GBP a month
